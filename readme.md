# List Concat

This project is meant to take in a comma separated list, and output the list in a combination.

# Example

**List Entered:** "Ice, Fire, Water, Grass"

**Output:** "Ice + Ice, Ice + Fire, Ice + Water, Ice + Grass, Fire + Water, Fire + Grass, Water + Grass..."

# Use Cases

This is meant to help me with a game project I am working on, so I can quickly list out all the different type combinations.
